## Empower Your Flarum Moderators with GeoIP

Moderators play a crucial role in maintaining the health and quality of forums. With GeoIP, give them the geolocation tools they need to better understand users, make informed decisions, and maintain a safe environment. Only moderators have access to IP-based geolocation, ensuring user privacy and data security.

### 🌎 Key Features
- **Location Insights**: Enable moderators to identify the country and region of users.
- **Interactive Mapping**: Let moderators visualize user locations with an integrated map view.
- **Threat Detection**: Equip moderators with the ability to highlight potentially malicious IP addresses through threat level indicators. (Via supported IP location data providers)
