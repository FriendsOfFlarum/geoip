### üë§ User Privacy Controls

Users have control over their location visibility:
- **Show country flag**: Users can opt-in to display their country flag on posts via their user preferences
- **IP addresses**: Only visible to administrators and moderators
- **Detailed location data**: Only accessible to administrators and moderators through the IP info modal

### CLI Usage

The following CLI commands are provided:

#### `lookup`

Although IP addresses will be looked up when they are requested, this command will lookup all IP's that do not already have an entry in the `ip_info` table, using the currently selected provider.

```sh
php flarum fof:geoip:lookup
```

#### `lookup --force`

You may also force a refresh of IP data using the currently selected provider.

```sh
php flarum fof:geoip:lookup --force
```

### Queue offloading

The IP lookup can be time consuming, so the lookup of an unknown IP address is dispatched in a job, if you have a queue running this will run on a worker thread, rather than the main thread.

All IP address lookup jobs are dispatched to the `default` queue by default. If you have multiple queues, you can specify which queue to use for these jobs in your `extend.php`:

```
FoF\GeoIP\Jobs\RetrieveIP::$onQueue = 'my-other-queue';
```

### Testing Your Configuration

The extension includes a built-in service tester in the admin settings interface. After configuring your chosen IP lookup provider:

1. **Save your settings first** - The tester uses your currently saved configuration
2. **Navigate to the test section** - Located at the bottom of the GeoIP settings page
3. **Enter an IP address** - Use any valid IPv4 or IPv6 address (defaults to 8.8.8.8)
4. **Click "Test Service"** - This will make a real request to your configured provider

The test results will show:
- **Service response status** - Success or error indication
- **Response time** - How long the lookup took
- **HTTP status code** - The actual HTTP response code from the service
- **Processed data** - The clean, formatted IP information
- **Raw response details** - Complete HTTP headers and response body for debugging
- **Request details** - The exact URL and options used for the request

This testing feature is invaluable for:
- Verifying API keys are working correctly
- Checking service availability and response times
- Debugging configuration issues
- Understanding what data your chosen provider returns

### üîß Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**IP lookups not working**
1. Check your service configuration in the admin panel
2. Use the built-in service tester to verify your setup
3. Ensure your API key is valid (for services that require one)
4. Check the Flarum logs for error messages

**Rate limit exceeded**
- IP-API: Requests are automatically queued, wait for the next minute
- IPData: Check your daily quota usage
- Consider upgrading to a paid plan for higher limits

**No country flags showing**
1. Ensure "Show country flag for each post" is enabled in settings
2. Users must opt-in via their preferences (unless admin permission overrides this)
3. Check that the IP lookup returned valid country data

**Queue not processing**
- Ensure your queue worker is running: `php flarum queue:work`
- Check queue configuration in your hosting environment

### ‚ö° Performance Considerations

- **Queue Processing**: IP lookups are processed in background jobs to avoid blocking page loads
- **Caching**: Results are cached to avoid repeated API calls for the same IP
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting prevents API quota exhaustion
- **Batch Processing**: Some providers support batch lookups for better efficiency

For high-traffic forums, consider:
- Using a paid provider with higher rate limits
- Ensuring your queue worker is properly configured
- Monitoring your API usage through provider dashboards

### üìä Data Storage

- IP geolocation data is stored locally in your database after lookup
- Data includes: country, coordinates, ISP, organization, and threat information (where available)
- No personal user data is sent to IP lookup providers
- Only IP addresses are transmitted for geolocation lookup

### Installation

Install manually with composer:

```sh
composer require fof/geoip:"*"
```

### Updating

```sh
composer update fof/geoip
php flarum cache:clear
```
